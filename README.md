Intersection Management for Cross Traffic Network


It is an Intelligent Real-Time Cross Trafﬁc network, which is a discrete system in which the vehicles coming from different directions reach their respective destinations via the Cross Trafﬁc network. The network comprises two simple modules- Endpoint and Junction Modules and a bidirectional Channel connecting the modules. I have implemented two strategies, dynamic signaling model and static signaling model in which we analyze each model’s performance for different input conditions obtained by varying the arrival times of the vehicles at the Junction module. The model’s performance is measured by the statistical techniques which let us know which model performs’s better and is favorable in which input condition.
